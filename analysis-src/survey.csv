Maybe the biggest thing a tool could do that I don't have now would be automatic extraction of common code sequences, not necessarily into ABI-compliant functions but just raw JAL/RET snippets -- especially using x5 on RISC-V (or equivalent) or Zcmt (not yet in shipping chips). On some machines a seamless ability to compile critical code to native code but most to a more compact bytecode/token form would be very useful -- I've never seen one that beats Thumb2 or RISC-V (especially with the Zb*/Zc* extensions implemented in Hazard3) but 8 bit ISAs are generally easily beaten (especially for code handling larger data items), as are arm64 and i386/x86_64. Small size of the interpreter is also critical, as is easy switching to/from native. A modern take on SWEET16 might be interesting, or a cross between that and the integer part of Transputer. Or a recoding of a simple 2-address 16 bit opcode RISC(ish) similar to PDP11, MSP430, or SH for easier software decoding might be best e.g. src and dst register fields in the same place in the hi and lo bytes of the instruction and offset by log2(wordSz/8) bits so a simple masking leaves them ready to index into a ""register"" array. Sorry, rambling. Obviously a compiler back end would be needed.",""

This was very important to us, with our system running on a bunch of different CPUs, as time went on, and sometimes multiple to ""many"" CPUs in one system.

Support for ""data endian-ness"" turned out to be useful, especially in network-related code.

There were some experiments with microkernels and vendor-provided RTOS-like things.  In general, I don't think they went very well :-(

Version control, bug tracking, source code management, and ""release management"" turned out to be important, even when ... hated.

""Open Source software"" turned out to be quite a can of worms, eventually requiring a legal team to approve (or license) any usage of OSSW code from outside the company.  Licensing of commercial/proprietary software probably could have used better management as well.  (I don't know how many ""copies"" of V.42bis licenses we ended up with.  A lot, I think.)","There were questions about how much we worried about ""real time performance"", and my answers were uniformly ""not too much.""  That's because we were running a bare metal homebrew OS, and making it perform was part of OUR task, not something that would fail because of the development environment (C.)  When things needed more speed, we get a faster CPU.
